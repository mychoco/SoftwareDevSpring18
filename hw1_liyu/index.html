<h2>Research Assistant, RPI</h2>
<p>
Summer 2017<br>
Built a Neural Network training model using Python and TensorFlow to detect aircraft sensor failure and give estimated correction. Added functionality to the PILOTS programming language in order to perform the self-healing process when the aircraft is in an abnormal mode.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Research Assistant, RPI</h2>
<p>
Summer 2016<br>
InsiderThreat: Wrote python scripts to read and process raw data and generate annotated data graph, used ontology to query annotated data and gather information about suspicious actions, and used stream reasoning to find out suspicious users that are potential threats to a company. Contributed to a conference paper as second author about stream reasoning.<br>
CHEAR (Child Health Exposure Analysis Repository): Used CmapTools to map the data ontology to graphs, used Protege to merge different data hierarchies and visualize them, and used SPARQL to query the semantic database stored in RDF format.
